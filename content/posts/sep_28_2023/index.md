Activation Engineering is the direct manipulation of activation vectors inside of a trained machine learning model. Potentially, it is a way to steer a model's behavior.

Activation engineering can be contrasted with other strategies for steering models: fine-tuning the models for desired behavior and crafting prompts that get a particular response.
